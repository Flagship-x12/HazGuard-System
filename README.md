HaxGaurd System - LPG Gas Leakage Detector
 
HaxGaurd System is an Arduino-based project designed to detect LPG gas leaks using the MQ-5 gas sensor. It provides real-time gas leakage detection and alerts the user through a buzzer or LED. The project aims to enhance safety in homes and industrial environments by providing an early warning in case of gas leaks.

# Features

Real-time Gas Detection: Detects LPG gas leaks using the MQ-5 gas sensor.

Alert Mechanism: Alerts the user via a buzzer or LED indicator when gas levels exceed a set threshold.

Threshold Sensitivity: The threshold value for gas detection can be adjusted based on the environment.

Expandable: Potential for integration with IoT systems or additional safety measures like turning off the gas valve automatically.

# Components

Arduino Uno (or compatible Arduino board)

MQ-5 Gas Sensor (MQ-2 can be used as an alternative)

Buzzer or LED for alert

Relay Module (optional, for cutting off gas supply or activating ventilation)

Jumper wires and breadboard

Power Supply for Arduino

# Installation & Setup

1. Hardware Setup:
Connect the MQ-5 gas sensor to the Arduino Uno:

VCC to 5V

GND to GND

A0 (Analog Output) to A0 on the Arduino (for analog readings)
D0 (Digital Output) for triggering an alert based on a threshold (optional).
Connect the buzzer to Pin 13 on the Arduino (or another digital pin of your choice).
(Optional) Connect a relay module to trigger actions such as cutting off the gas supply if leakage is detected.

2. Software Setup:
Download the Arduino IDE from Arduino's official website.
Open the Arduino IDE, copy and paste the code provided below, and upload it to your Arduino board.

# How to Use

1. Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
2. Monitor the Serial Monitor to view the gas sensor's readings.
3. When the gas concentration exceeds the preset threshold, the buzzer will activate, signaling a gas leak.
4. Optionally, connect a relay to control external devices (like shutting off the gas supply) when leakage is detected.

# Future Enhancements

IoT Integration: Connect to a Wi-Fi module (like ESP8266) for remote monitoring and alerting via mobile devices or email.

Data Logging: Store gas level readings over time for analysis and to monitor the systemâ€™s performance.

Smart Safety Measures: Implement a mechanism to turn off the gas supply or activate ventilation upon detecting a gas leak.
